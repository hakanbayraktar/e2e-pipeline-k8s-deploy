# Automated Deployment to Kubernetes Clusters with Jenkins
This Jenkins project provides the ability to automatically deploy to Kubernetes clusters. The project takes a deployment manifest from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, updates it with the latest image tags, and pushes the changes back. It then uses the Kubernetes API to automatically apply the deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

# Technical Features:

**Automatic Updates:** Deployment manifest is automatically updated with the latest image tags.     
**Repeatability:** Every deployment process is performed in a consistent and repeatable manner.   
**Error Reduction:** Reduces the risk of errors by minimizing the need for manual intervention.   
**Efficiency:** Speeds up the deployment process and saves time.  
**Use Cases:**

As part of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows
To quickly and reliably deploy new releases
To prevent manual deployment errors and delays

# How to Use:

**Set up the project in Jenkins:** Create a pipeline script for this project in Jenkins and make necessary configurations.
Set up required environment variables: Define environment variables containing your application's name and the latest image tag.
Run the Jenkins pipeline: Trigger the pipeline in Jenkins and wait for the automated deployment process to complete.
# Pipeline Stages:

**Cleanup Workspace:** Cleans up any existing artifacts and prepares the environment for a new deployment.  
**Checkout from SCM:** Retrieves the deployment manifest from an SCM like GitHub.   
**Update Deployment Tags:** Updates the deployment manifest with the latest image tags.   
**Patch the Changed Deployment File to Git:** Pushes the updated deployment manifest back to the Git repository.   
**Deploy to Kubernetes:** Uses the Kubernetes API to automatically apply the deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.   

# Notes:

This project requires basic knowledge of Kubernetes and Jenkins.
You can customize the Jenkins pipeline script according to your needs.
For more information, please refer to the pipeline script and the README file.
This project is a useful tool for anyone who needs to automate deployments to Kubernetes clusters. It provides an easy-to-use and customizable solution.
